# **De Novo Genome Assembly Pipeline**

## Welcome to your ultimate guide of using ready to go, containerized workflows for analyzing genome data.

> So you have sampled your organism of interest, sequenced the data, and found yourself with a bunch of NGS reads that need to be analyzed, but you don't really know how to proceed. Or, you do know, but you would rather spend your time writing your papers or examining another organisms in the meantime. In both cases, you are in the right space at the right time.
